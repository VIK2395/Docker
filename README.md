There is no reall need in Docker Desktop for Windows/Liux if we have docker engine installed in wsl2(Ubuntu) via `apt` repository https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/ \
In this case, we need to install docker-compose separately https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ as well via `apt` repository

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install \
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment \
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

Also, it is important to install node.js inside wsl2. Otherwise, we will try to run node.js project from windows wchich will result in errors.\

Problem explanation \
The reason is no real files on the host (or in containers) when containers are being created \
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34134343/single-file-volume-mounted-as-directory-in-docker

Solution \
Create files on the host before runnung the containers run.

# CMD vs ENTRYPOINT

In Docker, both `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` define the default commands that are executed when a container starts. However, they have slightly different purposes and behavior. Understanding their differences helps in determining how to structure your Dockerfile based on the intended behavior of the container.

### 1. **CMD**
- **Purpose**: The `CMD` instruction specifies the default command to be run when the container starts. It's mainly intended to provide **default arguments** for the `ENTRYPOINT` command or act as the main command if `ENTRYPOINT` is not specified.
- **Behavior**:
  - If the user provides a command when starting the container (e.g., `docker run myimage <command>`), the command specified in `CMD` will be **overridden**.
  - If you provide multiple `CMD` instructions in a Dockerfile, only the last one will take effect.

- **Example**:
  ```Dockerfile
  FROM ubuntu
  CMD ["echo", "Hello, World!"]
  ```

  In this example:
  - When the container runs, it will execute `echo "Hello, World!"` by default.
  - If you run `docker run myimage ls`, it will execute `ls` instead of the default `CMD` because the command `ls` overrides `CMD`.

- **Formats**:
  - **Shell form**: `CMD echo "Hello, World!"`
  - **Exec form**: `CMD ["echo", "Hello, World!"]`

### 2. **ENTRYPOINT**
- **Purpose**: The `ENTRYPOINT` instruction specifies the main executable that will always run when the container starts. It is used when you want the container to behave like an executable, where any additional arguments passed to `docker run` are treated as arguments to the `ENTRYPOINT` command.
- **Behavior**:
  - Unlike `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT` **cannot be easily overridden** by arguments passed to `docker run`. The command passed will be treated as arguments to the `ENTRYPOINT` command.
  - You can override `ENTRYPOINT` at runtime using the `--entrypoint` flag in `docker run`.
  - You can combine `ENTRYPOINT` with `CMD` to provide **default arguments**.

- **Example**:
  ```Dockerfile
  FROM ubuntu
  ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]
  CMD ["Hello, World!"]
  ```

  In this example:
  - When the container runs, it will execute `echo "Hello, World!"` by default.
  - If you run `docker run myimage Goodbye`, it will execute `echo "Goodbye"`, where `"Goodbye"` overrides the `CMD` argument but not the `ENTRYPOINT`.

- **Formats**:
  - **Shell form**: `ENTRYPOINT echo "Hello, World!"`
  - **Exec form**: `ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]`

### **CMD vs ENTRYPOINT Comparison**

| Aspect                | CMD                              | ENTRYPOINT                         |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Purpose               | Provides default arguments or a command to run. | Defines the main executable that should always run. |
| Overridable?          | Yes, can be overridden by `docker run <command>`. | No, unless overridden by `--entrypoint` option. |
| When to use?          | Use when the command can be overridden frequently. | Use when you want a fixed command with optional arguments. |
| Combination with the other? | Can be combined with `ENTRYPOINT` to supply default arguments. | Can be combined with `CMD` to provide default arguments. |

### **Combining ENTRYPOINT and CMD**

You can use both `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` in a Dockerfile. In this case:
- `ENTRYPOINT` defines the fixed command that will run.
- `CMD` provides default arguments to the `ENTRYPOINT` command.

**Example**:
```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT ["curl"]
CMD ["http://example.com"]
```
- When you run `docker run myimage`, it will execute `curl http://example.com`.
- If you run `docker run myimage http://google.com`, it will execute `curl http://google.com`, where `http://google.com` replaces the `CMD` argument but not the `ENTRYPOINT`.

### Docker Registry Protocols are implicit

- If the registry is reachable over **HTTPS** (the standard for security), Docker automatically uses it.
- If the registry is not using HTTPS and instead uses **HTTP**, Docker allows this but requires additional configuration due to security risks (more on this below).

### **Insecure Registries (HTTP)**
If your registry is using **HTTP** (an insecure protocol), Docker will block the connection by default due to security concerns. However, you can explicitly tell Docker to allow connections over HTTP by configuring it as an "insecure registry."

To use an HTTP registry, you must:

#### **Configure Docker for Insecure Registries**

**Edit Docker's daemon configuration**:
On most Linux systems, the configuration file for the Docker daemon is `/etc/docker/daemon.json`.

Add the following configuration to the file, specifying the registry you want to use with HTTP:

```json
{
 "insecure-registries": ["registry.example.com"]
}
```
On Docker-Desktop\
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8830c787-b5e5-4952-bf9e-10bd0c709e64)

Even though no protocol is specified in the command, Docker will now allow HTTP connections to that registry.

### Summary

- Docker **implicitly assumes HTTPS** when logging into a registry, so you don't need to specify the protocol.
- If the registry uses **HTTP**, you must configure Docker to allow "insecure registries."

## Credentials storage

On your local host, Docker stores authentication credentials (including tokens) in a configuration file located in your home directory. This file, `config.json`, holds the login credentials (username and token or password) used to authenticate with Docker registries.

### Location of Docker Credentials

The credentials to authenticate against private docker repositories are stored in the `config.json` file, usually located at:

- **Linux and macOS**: `~/.docker/config.json`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.docker\config.json`

### Viewing the `config.json` File

You can open and view the contents of `config.json` to see your tokens or stored credentials. Hereâ€™s an example of how the file looks:

```json
{
  "auths": {
    "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {
      "auth": "dXNlcm5hbWU6dG9rZW4="
    }
  },
  "HttpHeaders": {
    "User-Agent": "Docker-Client/19.03.12 (linux)"
  },
  "credsStore": "desktop"  // Only present if using credential helpers. Here desktop - means use of Docker-Desktop store
}
```

In this file:

- The `auths` section contains the authentication information for each registry. The `auth` field contains a **Base64-encoded** string of your username and token (or password).
  
  To decode the `auth` value:
  ```bash
  echo "dXNlcm5hbWU6dG9rZW4=" | base64 --decode
  ```
  This will output:
  ```bash
  username:token
  ```

### Credential Helpers

In many cases, Docker uses **credential helpers** instead of storing the token directly in `config.json`. This is indicated by the presence of `"credsStore"` or `"credHelpers"` fields.

- **credHelpers**: This is used to store your credentials securely using an external program such as `docker-credential-pass`, `docker-credential-osxkeychain`, or `docker-credential-wincred`.
- If credential helpers are enabled, Docker does not store the token in plain text or even encoded in `config.json`. Instead, the credentials are stored securely by the respective OS or tool (e.g., macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or a password manager like `pass`).

For example:
```json
{
  "auths": {
    "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {}
  },
  "credsStore": "desktop"
}
```

In this case, Docker is using a credential store (e.g., macOS Keychain) to manage authentication, and the actual token is not visible in `config.json`.

***Note: On my ubuntu OS, Docker-Desktop uses `pass` with `docker-credential-helpers`. So knowing how to deal with pass, we can see the creds.***

### To summarize:
- **`~/.docker/config.json`** contains your stored credentials or references to external credential stores.
- You can decode Base64-encoded tokens, but if credential helpers are used, the tokens are stored securely elsewhere.
